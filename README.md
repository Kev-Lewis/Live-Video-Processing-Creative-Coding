# Live Video Processing - (Creative Coding)

Instructions:

Left and Right Arrows: Increase or Decrease Framerate

Up and Down Arrows: Increase or Decrease StepSize

Enter: Show the text for framerate and stepsize values

Control: Show or hide original camera/video

-------------------------------------------
Description:

When I started playing around with this project, I noticed that there were
emojis that would pop up as characters when I made the values really high,
so I wanted to incorporate even more emojis into the camera. 

I found this website: https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp that shows the values of
emojis, so I set a random number to generate between the lowest and
highest values of emojis on this list. 

I liked the way it turned out because it would just randomly place emojis at a pretty good rate, but also a bunch of
random other characters so that the focus of the camera can still be seen. 

After that I added more options to adjust the parameters like increasing or decreasing framerate
and stepsize, and also the ability to show those parameters and show original
camera/video.
